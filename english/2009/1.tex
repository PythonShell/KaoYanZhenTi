\qquad Research on animal intelligence always makes me wonder just how smart humans are. \underline{\quad 1\quad}   the fruit-fly experiments described in Carl Zimmer’s piece in the Science Times on Tuesday. Fruit flies who were taught to be smarter than the average fruit fly \underline{\quad 2\quad}   to live shorter lives. This suggests that \underline{\quad 3\quad}   bulbs burn longer, that there is an \underline{\quad 4\quad}     in not being too terrifically bright.

\qquad Intelligence, it \underline{\quad 5\quad}    out, is a high-priced option. It takes more upkeep, burns more fuel and is slow \underline{\quad 6\quad}    the starting line because it depends on learning — a gradual \underline{\quad 7\quad}    — instead of instinct. Plenty of other species are able to learn, and one of the things they’ve apparently learned is when to \underline{\quad 8\quad}.

\qquad Is there an adaptive value to \underline{\quad 9\quad}    intelligence? That's the question behind this new research. I like it. Instead of casting a wistful glance \underline{\quad 10\quad}    at all the species we've left in the dust I.Q.-wise, it implicitly asks what the real \underline{\quad 11\quad}    of our own intelligence might be. This is \underline{\quad 12\quad}   the mind of every animal I’ve ever met.

\qquad Research on animal intelligence also makes me wonder what experiments animals would 13   on humans if they had the chance. Every cat with an owner, \underline{\quad 14\quad}   , is running a small-scale study in operant conditioning. we believe that \underline{\quad 15\quad}  animals ran the labs, they would test us to \underline{\quad 16\quad}   the limits of our patience, our faithfulness, our memory for terrain. They would try to decide what intelligence in humans is really \underline{\quad 17\quad}, not merely how much of it there is.   \underline{\quad 18\quad}, they would hope to study a \underline{\quad 19\quad}   question: Are humans actually aware of the world they live in? \underline{\quad 20\quad}   the results are inconclusive.
