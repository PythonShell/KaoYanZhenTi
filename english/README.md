This folder is the src for Graudate English Tests in China.

Now, I've finish the questions and answers from year 2005 to year 2013, and questions of year 2014.

My Environment is Texlive 2013 on Win 7, using pdfLaTeX engine.

I would try to add Makefile if possible.

Any discussions are welcomed. I will try to fix bugs and keep updating as years passing.

There are already compiled PDFs, you are recommend to download them, instead of build them by yourself, if you just wanna to find the Tests.

If you wanna to build PDFs or DVIs by yourself, just compile the whole.tex file in the sub folders.

```latex whole.tex```

then use `dvipdf` command to produce PDF from DVI:

```dvipdf whole```

With time allowed, I'll try to build some other format. Your advices are welcomed. Just tell me.
